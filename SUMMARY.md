**chw** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the livestock industry.

The dataset consists of 172 images with 265 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*ear-tag*).

Each image in the chw dataset has bounding box annotations. There is 1 unlabled image (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (17 images), *valid* (34 images), and *train* (121 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the [Roboflow community](https://universe.roboflow.com/jack-v5j2k).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
